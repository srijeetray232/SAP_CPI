# SAP CPI iFlow â€“ OData-Based Product Stock Report

This project demonstrates a real-world SAP Cloud Integration (CPI) iFlow that consumes a public OData service, processes product stock data, and generates a clean, formatted stock report.

## ðŸ’¼ Use Case

In a typical procurement or inventory management scenario, it's important to monitor product stock levels. This iFlow:
- Connects to a free public OData API
- Retrieves product data in XML format
- Parses and transforms the data using Groovy
- Outputs a professional, human-readable stock report (plain text)
- Flags low-stock products for reorder alerts

## ðŸ”§ Technology Stack

- **SAP BTP Integration Suite (CPI)**
- **OData Adapter**
- **Groovy Scripting**
- **Webhook.site** (for receiving HTTP output)

## ðŸ§ª Input & Output

### Input:
XML response from public OData service (e.g. Northwind Products)

### Output:
Formatted report with product name, units in stock, price, and reorder alert.

Example:
Product Stock Report
Product Name : Chang
Units In Stock : 17
Unit Price : $19.0
Reorder Alert : YES

Product Name : Aniseed Syrup
Units In Stock : 13
Unit Price : $10.0
Reorder Alert : YES
